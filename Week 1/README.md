# Week 1
Wooohooo! Can you believe we are already back to school? Neither do I... Anyways, I hope you're excited to learn about survey design!

Homework for the next week is as follows:

1. Read ["What is a Survey?" from "Surveys That Work"](What-Is-a-Survey_Surveys-That-Work.pdf)
2. And [Chapter 4 from "Handbook of Survey Methodology"](Chapter-4_Handbook-of-Survey-Methodology.pdf)

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me in any way!
